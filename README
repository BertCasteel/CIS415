Compilation instructions:
Makefile compiles only the shell (galactus)


Overiew of work accomplished:
I believe I have accomplished everything from Project 1 including one extra credit problem. My shell is named after the ficitonal cosmic entity-- Galactus, who is from The Fantastic Four Marvel comicbook series. Galactus eats planets.

Description of code:
galactus.c : shell, see comments
hello.c : contains syscall, was compiled into linux image
test.c : tests my hello syscall, returned 0

General comments:
I used execvp, which will search in bin if no / appears in the command agrument.

Number of hours spend on the project: 
over 15
